My website (re)written in React & Sass. Pretty barebone.

_Why?_ I was bored.

## Building

Run `npm i` to install all dependencies if you intend to clone (and/or) modify this.

### Core components

Below are the list of components/modules that needs further attention if you decide to modify & use your own instances of it:

- [use-lanyard](https://github.com/alii/use-lanyard)
- [lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard)
- [react-clock](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-clock) and the `Clock.tsx` file

## Archive

For the original page I've built previously using vanilla Typescript & HTML refer to the [legacy subdomain](https://legacy.kyrie25.me), or the [`legacy`](https://github.com/kyrie25/portfolio/tree/legacy) branch of this repository.

The information on the legacy page is outdated and most likely no longer relevant.
